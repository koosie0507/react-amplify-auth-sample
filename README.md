# react-amplify-auth-sample

Showcase the bare-minimum stuff that we can use to pull off authentication using:

* ⚛️ [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev) to scaffold the UI
* ☁️ [aws-amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/react/) to handle authentication
* 🧍 [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) for user management
